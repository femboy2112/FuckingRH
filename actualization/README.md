# Field-Relative Actualization System

## v0.3 research layer: categorical phenomenology and finite-to-circle duality

The new [categorical/Yoneda guide](YONEDA_GUIDE.md) documents an executable
source-history observer, full and restricted Yoneda, bounded prime-power
probeability certificates, finite co-Yoneda witness transport, and the exact
finite-clock / real-circle torsion pairing. These constructions are mathematically
meaningful independently of the RH program; they do not supply the Weil sign.

Quick demonstration commands:

```sh
python -m actualization yoneda-demo
python -m actualization local-global-demo
python -m actualization probe-budget --a 6 --b 12 --budget 3
python -m actualization probe-budget --lcm-horizon 10000 --budget 10000
python -m actualization circle-demo
```

The mathematical results, counterexamples and next actual RH interface are
recorded in [the categorical research frontier](../research/2026-10-10/CATEGORICAL_YONEDA_RESOURCE_FRONTIER.md),
with [reproducible CI evidence](../research/2026-10-10/CATEGORICAL_YONEDA_EVIDENCE.json).
The observer's agreement with a global description is always relative to its
declared probes, source context and resource budget; it is not a proof of
unobservable global truth.

A **working, bounded Python research engine** for how field-relative steps,
unrealized combinatorial data, contextual observations, and model integration
interact. Python 3.10+, standard library only. No zeta zeros, numerical fitting,
external services, or RH-based boundary conditions enter the package.

This is an implementation of the user's operational specification, not a claim
that mathematical truth is created by observation, that physical time has been
reversed, or that RH/Navier–Stokes has been solved.

## Start here

From the repository root:

```sh
python -m actualization demo --output /tmp/actualization-demo.json --trace /tmp/actualization-trace.json
python -m actualization shadow --horizon 3 --target 6
python -m actualization run --domain modular --modulus 2 --steps 4
python -m actualization run --source chi5 --steps 12 --output /tmp/chi5.json
python -m actualization replay /tmp/chi5.json
python -m actualization reverse /tmp/chi5.json --conjugate --output /tmp/reversed.json
python scripts/audit_actualization.py --output /tmp/actualization-audit
python scripts/mutate_actualization.py --output /tmp/actualization-mutations
```

A persisted trace is **data, not executable Python**. Replay validates the
configuration, exact operations, before/after states, sequence, and hash chain.
An externally stored `--expected-head` pins a particular trace. Hashes detect
changes but are not signatures or proof of external provenance.

## The five requirements implemented

| User specification | Implementation |
|---|---|
| SUCC is one unit step in a declared space; higher constructions attach synthetic basis data | `Frame` supplies the explicit direction; `BasisLift` carries exact finite unitary fiber transport |
| Shadow is unrealized state-space/field data | `ShadowIndex` retains a bounded ordered-factor history DAG; counts and signed projections are separate |
| Preserve field laws and coherent history; finite observation may be lossy | Exact arithmetic, declared norm checks, affine-chart covariance tests, immutable journal records, explicit non-reconstructible `view()` |
| Observation is specific to place, coordinate and context, then propagates into the model | `step()` registers an event; `propagate()` integrates it; predictions are not observed facts |
| Distinguish bare inverse, shadow inverse, global/conjugate causal reversal | `bare_inverse()`, predecessor-witness `shadow_inverse()`, full-state `reverse_last()/reverse_all()`, and coefficient/fiber `conjugated()` |

The distinction at 6 is literal: at N=3 it remains **shadow**, with paths (2,3)
and (3,2), even though its conductor is structurally available. At the step to
N=6 it is **observed**; only after propagation is it **integrated**. Its connected
Euler coefficient then vanishes. A zero connected coefficient does not erase the
observation or its histories.

## Minimal Python API

```python
from actualization import Engine, Frame, Limits, ONE, Scalar, source_at

engine = Engine(arithmetic=True, limits=Limits(max_target=64, max_depth=8))
engine.predict(6, ONE, "Declared multiplicative model; not a direct observation")
for n in range(1, 4):
    engine.advance(source_at(n), context="zeta", probe="coefficient")

six = engine.shadow(6, witnesses=True)
assert six["stage"] == "shadow"
assert six["weight"] == Scalar(-1).data()
assert six["witnesses"]["paths"] == [[2, 3], [3, 2]]

for n in (4, 5):
    engine.advance(source_at(n), context="zeta", probe="coefficient")
engine.step(source_at(6), context="zeta", probe="coefficient")
assert engine.shadow(6)["stage"] == "observed"
assert 6 not in engine.coefficients  # not filed in the model yet
engine.propagate()
assert engine.shadow(6)["stage"] == "integrated"
assert engine.shadow(6)["source"]["connected"] == Scalar(0).data()

copy = Engine.loads(engine.dumps(), expected_head=engine.head)
assert copy.state == engine.state
copy.reverse_all()  # lossless engine uncomputation, not erasure
assert copy.coordinate == (0,)
assert len(copy.records) == 2 * len(engine.records)
```

`advance()` is a convenience for two individual atomic journal operations. If
model integration fails, the raw observation deliberately remains pending;
`reverse_last()` can restore the earlier state. It must not be silently dropped.

## Fields, steps and synthetic bases

`Frame` supports N_0^d, Z^d, Q^d and (Z/mZ)^d with a declared nonzero step. These
are **spaces with operations**, not all fields: Z/mZ is a field only for prime m,
and N_0 has a boundary. A rational vector is not a floating approximation to an
arbitrary continuous field. Additional geometry needs an explicit adapter.

```python
from fractions import Fraction as Q
from actualization import AffineChart, BasisLift, Frame, Engine, I, ONE, Scalar

frame = Frame("Q2", "rational", (Q(1, 2), Q(-2, 3)))
chart = AffineChart((Q(2), Q(-3)), (Q(5), Q(7)))
x = (Q(0), Q(0))
assert chart.point(frame.succ(x)) == chart.frame(frame).succ(chart.point(x))

lift = BasisLift("phase", ((I, Scalar(0)), (Scalar(0), -I)), (ONE, I))
e = Engine(frame, lifts=(lift,))
e.advance(context="local chart")
```

The lift's unitary law is verified exactly before use. This is a **declared
conservation law**, not a derived arithmetic Hodge polarization. Nonunitary
fibers require a different adapter; they are not silently normalized.

In F_2, `0 -> 1 -> 0` revisits a coordinate without revisiting the same event.
The event sequence, field tick, coordinate, context, probe and integrated model
revision are retained separately.

`Operation` and `execute()` record every intermediate point of SUCC, inverse
SUCC, multiplication and partial division. Thus `2 -> 1 -> 2` is executable in
prefix [0,2], whereas `2 -> 4 -> 2` is not. A canceled endpoint expression does
not erase the intermediate execution cost. Structural factor paths in a shadow
are NOT automatically claimed to be prefix-executable trajectories.

## Shadow algebra and resource scope

The implemented arithmetic shadow is one named projection, not a universal
meaning of shadow state. For the set A of **integrated** source labels >=2:

    C_r(n) = number of ordered A-factorizations of n with length r
    W_r(n) = sum of products of their exact source coefficients
    sigma(n) = sum_{r>=2} (-1)^(r+1) W_r(n) / r

The DAG uses a divisor recurrence; witness enumeration is separate. When the
unit and all needed divisor events have arrived, `a(n)+sigma(n)` is the
coefficient of the formal Dirichlet-convolution logarithm. For genuine zeta it
is 1/k at n=p^k and zero at mixed composites. This is classical Euler-product
bookkeeping; see NIST DLMF 25.2.11: https://dlmf.nist.gov/25.2.E11 .

| Target | Earlier shadow weights | Connected value after encounter |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | N=2:0; N=3:-1 | 0 |
| 8 | N=2:1/3; N=4:-2/3 | 1/3 |
| 12 | N=3:1; N=4:0; N=6:-1 | 0 |

At N=4, **five** histories for 12 cancel: three triples contribute +1 and two
pairs contribute -1. Counts remain nonzero. Never use a zero projected weight
as evidence that the underlying shadow is absent.

`Limits` bounds target labels, factor depth, witness expansion, probe cells,
record count and serialized trace bytes. Exhaustion raises a typed error or
returns an explicit `complete=False`; requesting `exact_weight()` on an
incomplete expansion raises. A clipped witness listing does not corrupt a
separately complete aggregate. No full L_N residue space is allocated by the
conductor metadata routine. Default trace budget is 8 MB; no records are evicted
to stay within it. Snapshots take increasing memory: this is an inspectable
finite reference engine, not a scalable persistent database.

Coefficients live in Q(i), encoded as exact rational strings; arbitrary
irrational complex values are not claimed exact. Physical log degrees and the
Weil half-density are retained symbolically, with `clock_contract()` checking
the declared prime coordinates and exponent 1/2. There is no numerical Weil
operator or Gamma solver in this package.

## Observations, predictions and reversal

`predict()` files an explicitly attributed model assumption. It does not create
a source leaf or mark the target encountered. Integration records confirmation
or refutation and preserves the previous assumption in the journal. Repeated
observations at the same coordinate/probe/context can revise the model; a
new context gets a distinct fact key.

- `bare_inverse()`: returns one predecessor coordinate, with natural-boundary
  and modular-domain rules. No state or history is changed.
- `shadow_inverse()`: lists retained predecessor-event witnesses for the
  current coordinate. It does not assert that the coordinate identifies a
  unique past. Cycles provide direct counterexamples.
- `reverse_last()` / `reverse_all()`: uncompute recorded transitions using the
  retained exact before-state and strict causal stack order, appending reverse
  records rather than deleting forward records. This is a reversible software
  embedding by retained history, not a physical microscopic inverse.
- `conjugated()`: conjugates the exact coefficient/fiber data and its transport,
  then replays the same protocol. Applying it twice restores the original
  trace. Combining it with reversal is an operational test, NOT a constructed
  Archimedean antiunitary or absolute-geometric duality.

A `view(last=...)` is explicitly lossy; `Engine.loads()` refuses to reconstruct
from it. A hash-consistent but semantically wrong transition is also rejected.
External authenticity still requires an externally pinned head or signature.

## Tests and remaining proof boundary

The audit fans out into three **subprocess workers**, not independent AI agents:
field/path/covariance, exact shadow/source/probe, and observation/replay/reversal.
An independent recursive path enumerator checks the production DAG. Hostile
code mutants erase context, reverse step direction, discard pending events,
forget coefficient products, certify incomplete histories, skip replay checking,
forget conjugation, and reverse in the wrong order.

No passing local tests imply RH. In particular, a positive mixture of character
sectors can still be a nonmultiplicative scalar source; the engine records that
failure rather than declaring its covariance a prime event. Source admissibility,
field covariance, and reversible software history do not supply the missing
Gamma/polar/form-domain/Weil-sign identification.

Next extension: an explicit arithmetic-to-Archimedean probe transport whose
source trace, form-domain continuity and completed Weil comparison can be tested
against this recorded event history. Do not add a generic positive norm and call
it the RH solution.


## Infinite realization of finite observations (Ind/Yoneda)

The exact, bounded extension in [infinite_realization.py](infinite_realization.py)
is the mathematically precise meaning of an endless coherent arithmetic path:
finite stages L_N=lcm(1,...,N) define a **filtered colimit of Yoneda
representables** that is not representable by any finite integer. Each
finite test j eventually succeeds, but no finite L_N satisfies all j at once.
This is a theorem about an infinite directed diagram, NOT a computation
that executes infinitely many steps.

Try the reproducible standard-library demo:

~~~bash
python scripts/infinite_realization_demo.py --stage 12 --terms 12
python -m unittest discover -s tests/actualization -p test_infinite_realization.py -v
~~~

The same module constructs **certified rational intervals** converging to
pi and e, plus safe-half-plane zeta(s) intervals. It separately exhibits
a positive Hilbert-form limit whose *every finite stage is indefinite*,
and a negative-limit control with the same stagewise signature.
The Gamma bridge tests show that genuine Suzuki wavefront readings
stabilize *exactly* at each fixed event after enough observations.

**Do not infer RH from these mechanisms.** The divisibility-only Ind-object
cannot see a fake n=6 coefficient; zeta's analytic continuation uniquely
determines its zeros, but the universal Weil-positive sign remains open.

transport experiment: [Infinite realization research](../research/2026-10-10/INFINITE_REALIZATION_LIMITS.md).


## Prime-path Gamma successor germs

[gamma_succ_path.py](gamma_succ_path.py) makes a previously missing
distinction executable: scalar evaluation at the reflected point m=1
identifies the finite Euler ratio Z_P(2m)/Z_P(2)^m with 1, but does NOT
identify the two analytic construction paths or their derivatives.
The first displacement jet contains explicit finite prime logarithmic
moments and converges with a proved O(log(P)/P) tail bound.

An independent finite factorial SUCC path has Euler gamma approximation
G_N(z)=N! N^z/(z(z+1)...(z+N)), whose recurrence has finite defect
z(z+1)/(N+z+1), vanishing only in the infinite N limit.
The two-cutoff reflected transport replaces pi using the finite Euler
product and gamma using the finite factorial path; it tends to
zeta(1-2m) from the SAFE Euler half-plane Re(m)>1/2, including m=1.

A deliberately deformed Gamma sharing every factorial integer value and
the SUCC recurrence shows why extra analytic log-convexity constraints
are necessary to determine a unique archimedean continuation. Fake
composite Euler slots preserve scalar cancellation but change the jets:
provenance-sensitive does not mean RH-positive.

~~~bash
python scripts/gamma_succ_path_probe.py --prime-bound 53 --gamma-steps 64
python -m unittest discover -s tests/actualization -p 'test_gamma_succ_path.py' -v
~~~

The [derivation and proof boundary](../research/2026-10-10/SUCC_GAMMA_PRIME_PATH_GERMS.md)
explicitly distinguish classical identities, tested finite readouts,
and the still-open arithmetic-to-Weil fourth gate. No divergent Euler
product at -1 is assigned an ordinary sum or product value.


## Canonical selection by SUCC-shadow windows

The [SUCC-shadow selector](succ_shadow_window.py) probes *fractional,
boundary-crossing* curvature windows translated by integer successor
steps. For any continuous positive recurrence solution
F(x+1)=xF(x), F(1)=1, its ratio to Gamma is 1-periodic. The gamma
curvature decays as SUCC advances the window; a nonconstant periodic
gauge necessarily produces a negative convexity window eventually.
Thus exhaustive shadow probes with log-convexity select Gamma:
a concrete reading of Bohr–Mollerup, NOT a new RH theorem.

Exact rational witnesses reject sin(2π r x) periodic gauges (including
tiny deformations whose first witness lies beyond any chosen finite
horizon). A stronger hostile example is a continuous periodic
piecewise-quadratic gauge that is convex inside EVERY integer SUCC
cell but fails precisely at each cell boundary. Infinite scans
restricted to cell interiors **never** see its bad sign; crossing
the seam is indispensable.

A positive weighted measure on a complete countable family of windows
can select Gamma via a zero-violation functional; the weights do not
themselves prove uniqueness, and no canonical physical Feynman measure
has been constructed. Separately, loop winding for the multivalued
complex logarithm is retained as path history; symmetric Gaussian-like
winding damping fails strict inverse-path gluing.

python -m unittest discover -s tests/actualization -p test_succ_shadow_window.py -v

## Lambert W as a SUCC inverse and tree-path closure

[lambert_succ.py](lambert_succ.py) adds two complementary, explicitly
bounded uses of Lambert W, with separate negative controls:

1. **Factorial/Gamma SUCC inversion.** From a positive integer mass M,
   the principal W branch inverts only Stirling's BULK equation
   y=x(log x-1), where y=log M. The model then walks SUCC using exact
   factorial comparisons until it independently certifies
   n!<=M<(n+1)! and returns the prime valuations of n!. W never
   serves as the certificate, and its estimate cannot restore a
   lost multiplication history.
2. **Rooted-tree SUCC.** Finite exact rational coefficients are
   generated recursively from the labeled species T=X·SET(T),
   with \`T(z)=z exp(T(z))\`. The resulting tree generating
   function is \`T(z)=-W_0(-z)\`; its coefficients are
   \`n^(n-1)/Gamma(n+1)\` and their exact SUCC growth ratio
   \`(1+1/n)^(n-1) -> e\`. This selects an analytic principal
   branch from finite combinatorial history, not by a default
   numerical branch label.

A leaf-only SUCC construction provably misses labeled rooted trees
whose newest vertex is a root/internal point; the full shadow
decomposition matters. Fake tree coefficients first violate the
formal T=z exp(T) identity at their mutation degree. But fake
Euler-connected coefficients at integer 6 leave the factorial W
seed unchanged: this is a **deliberate RH-inertness control**.

~~~bash
python scripts/lambert_succ_probe.py --factorial-stage 32 --tree-stage 40

## Arithmetic Lambert W inside Dirichlet convolution

The [source-sensitive Dirichlet Lambert extension](dirichlet_lambert.py)
responds to a limitation of the scalar factorial-rank \`lambert_succ\`
model: feeding W the scalar \`log(n!)\` had *already erased* the Euler
coefficient at n=6. W itself was not the source of that blindness.

In the completed arithmetic algebra, define \`h=a-delta_1\` and
\`W_*(h)=sum (-k)^(k-1)/k! h^(*k)\` with Dirichlet convolution.
At each integer n this is a FINITE sum over ordered multiplicative
factorizations, so every coefficient comes with a complete source
history. The inverse equation \`W_*(h)*exp_*(W_*(h))=h\` is verified
coefficientwise with exact Fractions. The transform is reversible.

**Crucial hostile control:** true zeta \`a(n)=1\` gives W(6)=-1 and
connected Euler b(6)=0. A fake \`a(6)=2\` gives W(6)=0 and b(6)=1.
Therefore W(6) *vanishing* is not an Euler authenticity criterion.
Correct source recovery requires b(6)=W(6)+a(2)a(3).

There is a proper analytic transport in a declared safe domain:
if \`H_sigma=sum |h(n)|/n^sigma < 1/e\`, then
\`D_s(W_*(h))=W_0(D_s(h))\` follows by absolute Dirichlet convolution
and the scalar Lambert-series Taylor radius. The bounded implementation
also computes a numerical truncation-error envelope from positive
rooted-tree coefficients. No zero ordinates, critical strip continuation,
or positive Weil form are introduced.

## Two finite-SUCC-to-analytic continuation seams

[hasse_theta_seam.py](hasse_theta_seam.py) compares two rigorous,
independently defined routes to zeta's **global** analytic description,
with explicit source-integrity and positivity countermodels.

The Hasse/Sondow path builds the alternating eta function from
successive *integer SUCC differences*, never from zeta zeros.
At s=-m, polynomial finite differences TERMINATE and exactly recover
the rational values zeta(-m), including zeta(-1)=-1/12 and all
negative-even trivial zeros. A separate Hasse series with weights
1/(n+1) yields the same exact negative values without introducing
the local prime-2 denominator. Both are classical identities.

Gamma/Poisson instead builds **the entire xi function** from integer
Gaussian heat samples, including a rigorous exponentially small
truncation tail in 0<=Re(s)<=1. The two routes agree on the real
zeta source. Fake source a(6)=2 breaks the prime-2 parity
transport identity, makes a naive source-mutated Hasse expansion
diverge, and demonstrates why a *forced reflection-symmetric theta*
expression is NOT the completed Dirichlet function of that fake
source.

**Critical new observation in this round:** even though a trivial
zero zeta(-2m)=0 is exactly computable from finitely many SUCC
differences, its first and second spectral derivatives require
nonterminating SUCC-difference realizations. After Gamma/digamma
subtraction, the derivative ratio is the positive Euler current

~~~text
zeta''(-2m)/(2*zeta'(-2m)) + digamma(2m+1) - log(2*pi)
    = -zeta'(2m+1)/zeta(2m+1)
    = sum_p log(p)/(p^(2m+1)-1) > 0.
~~~

The code calculates the left via independent SUCC eta derivatives,
compares the safe Euler expression and gives an explicit upper bound
for omitted prime factors. This is classical arithmetic in the
convergent region, **not** the Weil positivity theorem.

Lastly, the [Riemann–Siegel asymptotic finite bulk window]
(https://dlmf.nist.gov/25.10.E3) uses
\`n<=floor(sqrt(t/(2*pi)))\` with the Gamma phase. This gives
the source's half-density/factor-square cone a genuine classical
comparison; the remainder cannot be dropped. A real-even quartic
with OFF-line zeros but strictly positive values on the critical
line is an exact hostility test against accidental "symmetry
proves RH" arguments.

## Coevolving theta windows and a zero-free finite Li hierarchy

The [balanced theta / Li module](balanced_theta_li.py) makes the
arithmetic–Archimedean observation horizon **coevolve**. The finite
lattice theta \`Theta_N(u)\` has a defect under Poisson reflection:
for fixed finite N, \`D_N(u)/exp(u/2)->1\` as u->+infinity.
For fixed u and N->infinity, the defect vanishes. So the two
independent limits DO NOT commute.

An exact erfc tail estimate yields a zero-blind, concrete
horizon prescription:
\`N(u,eps)>=exp(|u|)*sqrt((|u|/2+log(2/eps))/pi)\`.
The resulting Gamma/Poisson duality is controlled in *absolute*
error, not merely pointwise at fixed u. A wrong half-density
and a fake a(6)=2 Gaussian channel remain detectably wrong,
while the fixed-point probe u=0 is blind to fake weights.

The finite incomplete-Gamma SUCC recursion retains its explicit
boundary term. A direct finite rotating-Gaussian integral
independently confirms the user's reported finite double-zero
collision at T=0.3247799809425738... and its square-root
off-line splitting. These are NOT nontrivial zeta zeros.

Crucially, the finite theta kernels themselves define Li-like
coefficients **without reading any zeros**. A Cauchy estimate on a
provably zero-free disk about s=1 gives, for each degree k, a
closed-form source-derived error bound on the true Li coefficient:
\`|lambda_k(xi)-lambda_k(X_NT)| <=2k E_NT/((1-delta_r)r^k)\`,
\`0<r<=1/2\`. It is valid at ALL FIXED degrees but grows
exponentially in k; this is precisely why the construction
does not establish Li's globally quantified positive criterion.

Hostile calibration: at T=0.325 the finite theta model has a
verified numerical off-line pair while its first twelve Li-like
coefficients are still positive. Small-index positivity is
insensitive to this finite-model obstruction.

### One finite SUCC/Gamma horizon rule for every Li index

The full [Li-indexed diagonal theorem]
(../research/2026-10-10/BALANCED_THETA_LI_WINDOW.md#8-an-explicit-diagonal-infinity-of-finite-succ-windows-for-all-li-indices)
sets \(L_k=(2k+12)\log2+4\log(k+1)\),
\(T_k=\tfrac12\log(L_k/\pi)\), and
\(N_k^{Li}=\lceil\sqrt{L_k/\pi}\rceil+1\).
The **exact analytic estimates** ensure
\`|lambda_k(xi)-lambda_k(X_Nk,Tk)|<2^-k\`
for EVERY positive integer k, without reading zeros. Thus each
Li index has an explicitly prescribed finite Gaussian/SUCC
window with a certified ideal-integral error inequality.

The Li-only source cutoff \(N_k\) and \(e^{T_k}\) both scale
like \(\sqrt{k}\)—structurally reminiscent of the known
Riemann–Siegel factor-square, with Li index **not** to be
confused with spectral height. To ALSO enforce the *pointwise*
finite theta reflection error \(|D_{N_k}(T_k)|<2^{-k}\),
use \`li_coevolving_diagonal(k, match_reflection=True)\`,
which increases the source cutoff to \(O(k)\).

This proves **accuracy**, NOT the positivity of lambda_k. A
uniform source-derived lower bound on the Li coefficients
would still be required for RH.
